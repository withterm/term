## Getting Started

<!-- Set the context - what are we building/exploring? -->

Let's start by [describing what we're going to do]. This will help you understand [key concept].

## Step 1: [First Learning Step]

<!-- Each step should introduce ONE new concept -->

First, let's [action]. This demonstrates [concept being taught].

```rust
// Code that the user types
// Keep it minimal and focused on the learning objective
```

Run this code:
```bash
cargo run
```

You should see:
```
[Expected output]
```

## Step 2: [Next Learning Step]

Now let's expand on what we learned by [action]. Notice how [connection to previous step].

```rust
// Build on previous code
// Introduce exactly ONE new concept
```

### Try It Yourself

## Step 3: [Building Understanding]

<!-- Continue building complexity gradually -->

Let's see what happens when [scenario]. This is important because [real-world connection].

```rust
// More complex example building on previous steps
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** [Describe a common error beginners make and how to avoid it]

## Step 4: [Consolidating Learning]

Now let's put it all together. We'll [final action that combines concepts].

```rust
// Complete example showing all concepts learned
```
